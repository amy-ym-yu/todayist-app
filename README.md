This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Base Project

I started following [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/build-a-simple-todo-app-using-react-a492adc9c8a4) tutorial, then used the base todo list and its concepts to extend the app. Features added: creating/deleting lists, renaming lists, adding functioning database, logging in have your own lists.

I used Google Firestore for database purpose and Firebase for deployment. You can demo the project here. https://todayist-c3b28.web.app
